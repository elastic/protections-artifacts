[rule]
description = """
Detects the execution of a MacOS installer package with an abnormal child process (e.g bash) followed immediately by a
network connection via a suspicious process (e.g curl). Threat actors will build and distribute malicious MacOS
installer packages, which have a .pkg extension, many times imitating valid software in order to persuade and infect
their victims often using the package files (e.g pre/post install scripts etc.) to download additional tools or
malicious software. If this rule fires it should indicate a the installation of a malicious or suspicious package.
