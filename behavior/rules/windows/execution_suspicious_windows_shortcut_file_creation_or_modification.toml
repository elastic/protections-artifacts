Identifies when an unusually large Windows Shortcut (LNK) file is created or modified with a suspicious file name.
Adversaries may embed malicious scripts or files in a shortcut file before delivering it to their target and tricking
them into executing the payload. Adversaries also leverage malicious shortcut files to maintain persistence on an
endpoint and ensure that their malicious code is executed when a routine event occurs such as when a user logs in to
Windows.
