Detects curl process execution from a volume mount. This activity is highly abnormal and indicates potential malicious
activity. Threat actors will disguise their malware as legitimate dmg installer applications, like Adobe Reader or
popular Cryptocurrency apps, and use curl to download a second stage payload or establish initial C2. This activity has
been observed recently in various malware samples.
