[rule]
description = """
This rule detects the enabling of write access to the Model Specific Registers (MSR) through the modprobe command. The
MSR provides a mechanism for the operating system to interact with the processor's hardware. Enabling write access to
the MSR may allow an attacker to modify the processor's configuration. This activity is seen by adversaries as a way to
increase mining performance or to bypass security mechanisms.
