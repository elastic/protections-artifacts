Identifies network connections to the standard Kerberos or SMB ports from an unusual process followed by the creation of
a sensitive file such as kerberos ticket and certificate keys. On Windows, the only native system process that normally
performs Kerberos traffic from a domain joined host is lsass.exe and SMB is the System virtual process. This may
indicate an ongoing Kerberos attack.
