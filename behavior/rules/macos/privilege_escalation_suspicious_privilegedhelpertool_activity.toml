Detects the potential abuse of a PrivilegedHelperTool by triggering on the execution of specific system binaries where
the parent process is a privilegedhelpertool. This activity is not normal or common and could indicate a
privilegedhelpertool exploitation bypass attempt. PrivilegedHelperTools are sometimes targeted via injection and XPC
manipulation to bypass macOS security controls in order to elevate privileges, establish privileged persistence, or
