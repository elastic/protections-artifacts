Identifies instances where a dynamic library (dylib) is loaded from a volume mount path on macOS. Threat actors may
abuse this technique to load malicious dylibs from external or mounted volumes, which can be used to perform code
injection, persistence, or privilege escalation. By loading a dylib from a volume mount path, attackers can bypass
certain security mechanisms and avoid raising suspicion as the malicious code is not stored within the application
bundle or the system's default library locations.
