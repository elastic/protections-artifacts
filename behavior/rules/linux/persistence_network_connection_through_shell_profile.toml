[rule]
description = """
This rule identifies a network connection initiated by a process that was spawned as a child of an authentication event.
Threat actors can establish persistence by altering shell profile configurations to execute malicious commands or
scripts upon user login. These modifications cause the shell launched during login to execute the malicious payload,
resulting in a sequence where an authentication event is followed by shell execution, which subsequently triggers the
payload.
