Detects when an audio plug-in is manually loaded by the auval or auvaltool process followed by an immediate outbound
network connection. Applications such as GarageBand 10, Logic Pro X, Audacity, etc., use audio unit plug-ins to create
sound effects and virtual instruments. Software developers and sound engineers can create either audio components or
virtual studio technology (VST) plug-ins. Threat actors can also create audio components or plug-ins and load them to
execute unsigned code via the native auval or auvaltool binaries.
