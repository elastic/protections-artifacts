description = """
Identifies the creation of a launch agent or daemon property list file containing abnormal or suspicious values. An
adversary may establish persistence by installing a new launch agent or daemon which executes at login. This rule looks
within newly created property list files for a set of specific keys and values that contain certain file paths or system
binaries malware has commonly used when implementing persistence via this method.
