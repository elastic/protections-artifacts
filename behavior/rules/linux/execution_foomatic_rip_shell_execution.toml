description = """
This detection rule addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the CUPS printing system, including CVE-2024-47176,
CVE-2024-47076, CVE-2024-47175, and CVE-2024-47177. Specifically, this rule detects shell executions from the
foomatic-rip parent process. These flaws impact components like cups-browsed, libcupsfilters, libppd, and foomatic-rip,
allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to manipulate IPP URLs or inject malicious data through crafted UDP packets or
network spoofing. This can result in arbitrary command execution when a print job is initiated.
