Detects when an executable file is created by the base64 system binary. Malware, specifically OceanLotus in this case,
can bring along an embedded second stage payload that is base64 encoded. Upon execution the initial access payload
decodes this second stage encoded payload and creates a new executable file. This activity is inherently malicious and
should not occur normally under any circumstance.
