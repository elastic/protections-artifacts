This rule detects the execution of gsocket binaries or scripts that may be used to establish a reverse shell or
exfiltrate data from a compromised system. Gsocket is a tool that can be used to create a reverse shell, transfer files,
or mount remote directories over a network connection. This activity may indicate an attacker is attempting to establish
persistence or move laterally within a network.
