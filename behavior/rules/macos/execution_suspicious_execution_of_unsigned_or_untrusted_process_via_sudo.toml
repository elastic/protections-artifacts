Detects when Sudo is used to execute an untrusted or unsigned binary via the -S option allowing a password or
pre-gathered key to be piped to the binary upon execution. A recent stealer sample was seen executing a second stage
payload in this manner passing the user provided password to supply the second stage payload with upon execution. The
use of Sudo with the -S option in itself is not common but when its used to execute an untrusted or unsigned binary it
should be considered highly suspicious acitvity.
