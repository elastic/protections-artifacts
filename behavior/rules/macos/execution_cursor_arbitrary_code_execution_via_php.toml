description = """
Cursor disables a crucial security feature: Workspace Trust, which in VS Code helps prevent inadvertently running unsafe
scripts or extensions. This omission poses a risk: attackers could embed malicious configurations like a
.vscode/settings.json pointing to a harmful executable and trigger code execution just by opening a project. This rule
detects the exploitation of this feature.
