Detects when an Application's Dock Tile Plugin gets mapped into memory by the macOS XPC external dock service process.
Threat actors can add Dock Tile Plugins to their applications (APP_NAME.app/Contents/PlugIns/DockTile). The plugin will
be recognized by launch services, registered, and the plugin will be loaded. These plugins are not visible to the user,
can react to various system events, and will be loaded at each login, so persists across reboots, and runs inside a
legitimate system process which is not sandboxed.
