Detects potential malicious elevated command executions on macOS by monitoring processes spawned by authtrampoline,
which handles macOS privilege escalation. It flags processes with untrusted or missing code signatures, commonly abused
process names like osascript, curl, and dscl, as well as shell executions with suspicious arguments. The aim is to
swiftly identify and respond to abnormal elevated activities on a macOS system.
