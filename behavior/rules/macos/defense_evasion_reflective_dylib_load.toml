Detects the potential loading of a dylib from memory by looking for dylib load events without a dll.path present
indicating the dylib was not loaded from disk. Loading a dylib directly into memory is a technique often used by
attackers to evade detection. This is because loading a dylib directly into memory leaves no traces on the disk, making
it harder for security tools or analysts to detect the malicious dylib.
