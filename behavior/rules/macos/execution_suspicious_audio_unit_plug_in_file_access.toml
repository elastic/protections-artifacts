description = """
Detects when an audio component or plug-in is created or accessed by a suspicious process. Applications such as
GarageBand 10, Logic Pro X, Audacity, etc., use audio unit plug-ins to create sound effects and virtual instruments.
Software developers and sound engineers can create either audio components or virtual studio technology (VST) plug-ins.
Threat actors can also create audio components or plug-ins and load them to execute unsigned code via the native auval
or auvaltool binaries.
