[rule]
description = """
This rule detects potential malicious activity on macOS endpoints by identifying modifications to Finder-related cache
files by suspicious processes. It targets adversarial techniques, such as those used by the XCSSET malware, where an
attacker maintains persistence by modifying system configurations—like the Dock plist (com.apple.dock.plist)—to execute
malicious code each time the Dock or Launchpad is launched. The rule triggers when a file modification event occurs,
involving processes such as osascript, bash, sh, zsh, curl, or nscurl, or when the modifying process lacks a valid code
signature or is untrusted.
