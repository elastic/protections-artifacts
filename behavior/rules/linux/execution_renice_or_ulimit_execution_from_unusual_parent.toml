[rule]
description = """
This rule detects the execution of the renice or ulimit commands from an unusual parent, which are used to change the
priority of processes or set resource limits for processes. Threat actors may abuse these commands to change the
priority of malicious processes. This is commonly used by miner malware to increase the priority of mining processes to
maximize the mining performance.
