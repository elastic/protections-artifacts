[rule]
description = """
This detection rule addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the CUPS printing system, including CVE-2024-47176,
CVE-2024-47076, CVE-2024-47175, and CVE-2024-47177. Specifically, this rule detects suspicious process command lines
executed by child processes of foomatic-rip and cupsd. These flaws impact components like cups-browsed, libcupsfilters,
libppd, and foomatic-rip, allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to manipulate IPP URLs or inject malicious data
through crafted UDP packets or network spoofing. This can result in arbitrary command execution when a print job is
initiated.
