[rule]
description = """
This rule detects the `at` utility being launched through `udevadm`. The `at` utility is used to schedule tasks to be
run at a later time. This could be used by an attacker to establish persistence on a system. The `udevadm` utility is
used to manage device events and could be used to trigger the `at` utility to run at a specific time, providing a threat
actor with persistence.
