[rule]
description = """
This rule detects potential process masquerading as a kernel process. Attackers may leverage the `exec -a` command to
change the name of a process to mimic a kernel process, such as `kworker`, `ksoftirqd`, or `kthreadd`. When `exec` is
spawned directly, it will kill the currently running shell, and continue to run as the masqueraded process. This leads
to spawning a process with only one process argument, which is the name of a kernel thread (hence the brackets). This
technique is used by malware to hide the true identity of a process from security tools and analysts.
