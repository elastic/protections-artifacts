Detects when a dylib is loaded from a temporary directory by a binary that is not located in the temporary directory as
well. Dylibs on macOS are loaded from within the applications directory structure itself or the system frameworks or
system libraries path. Loading a dylib from a place like /tmp is highly suspicious and should be considered a sign of
malicious activity.
