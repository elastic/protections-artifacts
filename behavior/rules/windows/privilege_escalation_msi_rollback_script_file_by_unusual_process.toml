Identifies the creation or modification of a Windows Installer rollback script (rbs) by an unusual process. Rollback
script files instruct the MSI service to rollback all the modification in the case of a failed installation. This
behavior can be abused by an adversary to replace a legit rbs file with a rogue one via a file system oplock and race
condition, then triggering an MSI rollback operation leading potentially to a privilege escalation.
