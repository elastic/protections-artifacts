description = """
This rule monitors for the potential memory dump of the init process (PID 1) through gdb. Attackers may leverage memory
dumping techniques to attempt secret extraction from privileged processes. Tools that display this behavior include
"truffleproc" and "bash-memory-dump". This behavior should not happen by default, and should be investigated thoroughly.
