description = """
Message of the day (MOTD) is the message that is presented to the user when a user connects to a Linux server via SSH or
a serial connection. Linux systems contain several default MOTD files located in the "/etc/update-motd.d/" and
"/usr/lib/update-notifier/" directories. These scripts run as the root user every time a user connects over SSH or a
serial connection. Adversaries may create malicious MOTD files that grant them persistence onto the target every time a
user connects to the system by executing a backdoor script or command. This rule detects the execution of potentially
malicious processes through the MOTD utility.
