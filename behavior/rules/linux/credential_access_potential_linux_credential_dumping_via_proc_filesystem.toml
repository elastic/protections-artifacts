Identifies the execution of the mimipenguin exploit script which is linux adaptation of Windows tool mimikatz.
Mimipenguin exploit script is used to dump clear text passwords from a currently logged-in user. The tool exploits a
known vulnerability CVE-2018-20781. Malicious actors can exploit the cleartext credentials in memory by dumping the
process and extracting lines that have a high probability of containing cleartext passwords.
