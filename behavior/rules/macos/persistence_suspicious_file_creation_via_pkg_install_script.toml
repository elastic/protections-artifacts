Detects when an installer package executes a pre or post install script that immediately copies a file, like an
executable, to somewhere on the filesystem. This activity is not common and usually indicates a malicious package
attempting to install persistence or establish a working directory. Various different types of malware have been seen
using this technique to move a plist file into the LaunchDaemons or LaunchAgents directories or moving an executable
into an existing system folder or newly created folder as a home directory for the malware.
