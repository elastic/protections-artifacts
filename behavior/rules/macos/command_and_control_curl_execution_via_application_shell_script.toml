Detects the abnormal spawning of curl or nscurl by a shell script within an applications directory structure. Threat
actors have executed and abused shell scripts within a benign applications directory structures in order to evade
detection and download a second stage payload. This specific activity has been observed when the shell script creates a
new shell child process ,via a fork, which is then used to execute curl or nscurl. The use of shell scripts within a
macOS application to execute curl is highly abnormal espcially in this specific manner.
