description = """
This detection rule addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the CUPS printing system, including CVE-2024-47176,
CVE-2024-47076, CVE-2024-47175, and CVE-2024-47177. Specifically, this rule detects network connections initiated by a
child processes of foomatic-rip. These flaws impact components like cups-browsed, libcupsfilters, libppd, and
foomatic-rip, allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to manipulate IPP URLs or inject malicious data through crafted
UDP packets or network spoofing. This can result in arbitrary command execution when a print job is initiated.
