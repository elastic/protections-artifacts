Detects the use of curl by a macOS application binary to connect to a raw IP URI and download a second stage payload to
another directory on the system. Threat actors will often utilize a benign looking or legitimate application as a first
stage in order to trick users and bypass Apple's controls. This first stage will usually act as a dropper for the actual
payload. Curl is often used as it doesn't enforce Gatekeeper checks.
