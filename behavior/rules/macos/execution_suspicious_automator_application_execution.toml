Detects when a Automator application ("Application Stub") is executed via XPC. The "Application Stub" binary on macOS is
associated with Automator, a tool that allows users to create automation scripts without needing to write code. When
creating applications with Automator, the default name for the executable is "Application Stub". This is the standard
naming convention used by Automator. Threat actors have been seen recently utilizing Automator applications to infect
macOS systems in an attempt to fly under the radar by abusing Apple's built in automation framework.
