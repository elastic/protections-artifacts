Detects the execution of an unsigned or untrusted binary by a shell interpreter via an XPC call. This activity can be
carried out in several ways but the most common is when a Login Item gets created that is specified to execute a
specific binary (in this instance an unsigned or untrusted binary). Threat actors will often utilize Login Items as a
persistence mechanism to launch their payloads on system boot.
