Identifies attempts to tamper with the executable file of a process. Attackers may attempt to tamper with the executable
file of a process in order to run or inject malicious code via techniques such as Process Ghosting or Process
Doppelgänging. Attackers may use these techniques in attempts to evade process-based defenses and in some cases, to
elevate privileges. Process Ghosting is a technique where an attacker can write a malicious file to disk in such a way
that it is difficult for security tools to scan or delete - and where the deleted malicious file is subsequently
executed as though it were a regular file on disk. Process Doppelgänging is a technique that exploits Transactional NTFS
to execute arbitrary code in the address space of a separate running process, without committing the code to disk.
