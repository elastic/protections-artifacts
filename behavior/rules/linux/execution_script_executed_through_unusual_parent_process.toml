description = """
This rule detects the execution of scripts by interpreters like Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, and Lua, when the parent
process is located in an unusual location, or the parent process is hidden. This behavior is often seen in malware that
is trying to evade detection by executing scripts from temporary directories or hidden locations.
