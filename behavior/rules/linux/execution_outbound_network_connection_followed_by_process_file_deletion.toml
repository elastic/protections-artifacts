description = """
This rule detects a network connection attempt to an external IP address followed by a file deletion event where the
file path is the same as the process executable. This behavior may indicate an attempt to cover tracks by deleting the
file used to establish the connection, and may be used by attackers to hide their tracks upon successfully establishing
a connection to a C2 server.
