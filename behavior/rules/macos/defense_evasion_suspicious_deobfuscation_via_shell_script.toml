Detects when a large shell script is executed followed by the execution of the base64 or xxd binary. Threat actors will
often use shell scripts to obfuscate their commands in order to avoid detection. The use of base64 or xxd to decode the
shell script is indicative of a threat actor attempting to deobfuscate their commands.
