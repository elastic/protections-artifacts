Adversaries may load a driver to a compromised machine to execute code in kernel mode. A majority of legitimate kernel
driver installations involve a new service creation via the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) which generate audit
logs. Adversaries can leverage the undocumented Windows API NtLoadDriver to load a driver directly, avoiding service
creation traces.
