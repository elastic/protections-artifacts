Identifies the creation or modification of a Windows Installer rollback script (rbs) by an unusual process followed by
the execution of process as SYSTEM. rbs files instruct the MSI service to rollback all the modification in the case of a
failed installation. This behavior can be abused by an adversary to replace a legit rbs file with a rogue one via a file
system oplock and race condition, then triggering an MSI rollback operation leading potentially to a privilege
escalation.
