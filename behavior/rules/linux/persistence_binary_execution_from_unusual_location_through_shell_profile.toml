[rule]
description = """
This rule identifies a process that executes a binary from an unusual location through a shell profile configuration.
Threat actors can establish persistence by altering shell profile configurations to execute malicious commands or
scripts upon user login. These modifications cause the shell launched during login to execute the malicious payload,
resulting in a sequence where an authentication event is followed by the execution of a payload in a suspicious
location.
