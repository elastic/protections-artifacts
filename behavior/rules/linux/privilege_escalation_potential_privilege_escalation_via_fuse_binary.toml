description = """
This rule identifies the execution of the "fuse" binary by the root user, excluding cases where the user's group is not
root or the parent process is sudo. Such behavior is likely considered anomalous and may suggest an attempt at privilege
escalation, potentially leveraging the CVE-2023-0386 vulnerability.
