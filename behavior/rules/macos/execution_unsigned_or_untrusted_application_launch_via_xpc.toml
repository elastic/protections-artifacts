Detects when the xpcproxy process starts an application within the /Applications directory, and the parent process is
/sbin/launchd. If an application is being launched via xpcproxy with launchd as its parent process, it generally means
the application is being started as an XPC service. An application being executed in this specific manner is not normal
and based on testing can indicate a malicious application being launched.
