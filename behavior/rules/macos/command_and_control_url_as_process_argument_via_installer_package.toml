Detects when a url is supplied as a command line argument to an installer package binary via the installer process
itself. This technique is a creative way to download a second stage payload and evade curl based detections. This
activity can be observed when in a pre or post install script it specifies a url as an argument to a binary included in
the package that when executed will reach out to the specified url.
