Detects when curl is executed as part of a shell script that gets executed via a forked shell interpreter. The activity
has been observed in many different samples of the malware known as Shlayer. Shlayer uses this technique in order to
avoid traditional scanning and command line detections. The Shlayer malware brings along an encoded shell script within
a, usually, signed or sometimes valid application that gets decoded and passed to a forked shell interpreter (to avoid
process lineage detections) for execution via the "-c" command parameter.
