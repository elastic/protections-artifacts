Detects when a Launch Agent or Launch Daemon is created in a common way by moving the plist into one of the two
directories using the native cp or mv binaries and the plist arguments contain a common application path followed
immediately by the execution of an untrusted or unsigned binary from that path. Threat actors will regularly get users
to install untrusted or unsigned applications, usually impersonating a valid application, in a normal system location
and the application will install a launch services persistence that looks generic and won't generally raise suspicion.
