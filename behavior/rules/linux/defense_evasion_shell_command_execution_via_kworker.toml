description = """
This rule monitors for the execution of shell commands via a kworker parent process. kworker, or kernel worker,
processes are part of the kernel's workqueue mechanism. They are responsible for executing work that has been scheduled
to be done in kernel space, which might include tasks like handling interrupts, background activities, and other
kernel-related tasks. Attackers may attempt to evade detection by masquerading as a kernel worker process.
