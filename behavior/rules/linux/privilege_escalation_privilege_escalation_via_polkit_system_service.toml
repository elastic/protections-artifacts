description = """
A vulnerability exists within the polkit system service that a local, unprivileged attacker can leverage to perform
privileged operations. In order to leverage the exposure, the attacker invokes a method over D-Bus and kills the client
process. This will occasionally cause the operation to complete without being subjected to all necessary
authentications. The exploit can then be used to add a new user with sudo access and a known password. The new account
is then leveraged to execute a payload with root privileges.
