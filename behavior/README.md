## Elastic Security Malicious Behavior Protection Rules

Prebuilt high signal [EQL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/eql.html) rules that runs on the endpoint to disrupt malicious behavior, this layer of prevention equips Elastic Agent to protect Linux, Windows, and macOS hosts from a broad range of attack techniques with a major focus on the following tactics :

- [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/)
- [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/)
- [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/)
- [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/)
- [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/)
- [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040/)

Prevention is achieved by pairing post-execution analytics with response actions to kill a specific process or a full process tree tailored to stop the adversary at the initial stages of the attack. Each protection rule is mapped to the most relevant [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) tactic,  technique and subtechnique.

The true positive rate that we aim to maintain is at least 70%, thus we prioritize analytics logic precision to reduce detection scope via prevention.

Another example of our commitment to openness in security is our existing public [Detection Rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules) repository where we share [EQL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/eql.html) rules that run on the SIEM side, and that have a broader detection logic which make them more suitable for detection and hunting.
