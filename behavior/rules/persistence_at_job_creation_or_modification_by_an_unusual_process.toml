description = """
Detects the creation or modification of an At job by a suspicious process. This activity should almost never take place
as Apple is slowly deprecating it and atrun execution is disabled by default. If this rule fires it should indicate
highly abnormal or malicious activity. Threat actors can abuse the atrun scheduler to persist their binaries on a
system.
