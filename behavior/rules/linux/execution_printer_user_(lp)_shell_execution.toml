description = """
This detection rule addresses multiple vulnerabilities in the CUPS printing system, including CVE-2024-47176,
CVE-2024-47076, CVE-2024-47175, and CVE-2024-47177. Specifically, this rule detects shell executions from the
foomatic-rip parent process through the default printer user (lp). These flaws impact components like cups-browsed,
libcupsfilters, libppd, and foomatic-rip, allowing remote unauthenticated attackers to manipulate IPP URLs or inject
malicious data through crafted UDP packets or network spoofing. This can result in arbitrary command execution when a
print job is initiated.
