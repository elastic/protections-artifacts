Detects the execution of an unsigned or untrusted binary via the Zsh shell startup file .zshrc. Threat actors can modify
the .zshrc file with the path to their payload in order to persist on a victims system. When the host reboots the
payload will be executed and this is the activity you will see. A recent DPRK payload, ThiefBucket, implements this
persistence mechanism.
