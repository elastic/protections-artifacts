Identifies when a macOS installer package is executed followed by the execution of a utility that's commonly used by
attackers when downloading a payload, establishing persistence, profiling an endpoint, or decompressing/decoding a file
before execution. An attacker may configure an installer package to download an additional payload or malware for
execution to gain initial access or establish persistence on an endpoint.
