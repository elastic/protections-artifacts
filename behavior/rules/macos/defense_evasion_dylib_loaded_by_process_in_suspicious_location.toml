Identifies instances where a dynamic library (dylib) is loaded by a process running from a suspicious or non-standard
path on macOS. Threat actors may abuse this technique by using compromised or malicious processes originating from
unusual locations to load dylibs for code injection, persistence, or privilege escalation. A dylib loaded from a
suspicious process path can indicate that the process itself is malicious, has been tampered with, or is attempting to
evade detection by operating from a non-standard location.
