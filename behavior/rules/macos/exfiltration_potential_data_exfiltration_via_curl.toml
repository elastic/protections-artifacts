Detects the use of curl to upload an archived file to an internet server. Threat actors often will collect data on a
system and compress it in an archive file before exfiltrating the file back to their C2 server for review. Many threat
actors have been seen utilizing curl to upload this archive file with the collected data to do this. Use of curl in this
way while not inherently malicious should be considered highly abnormal and suspicious activity.
