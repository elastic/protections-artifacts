description = """
Langflow is a tool that allows users to create and manage workflows for language models. This rule detects potential
remote code execution attempts through the Langflow application, as a result of a vulnerability (CVE-2025-3248).
Langflow versions prior to 1.3.0 are susceptible to code injection in the "/api/v1/validate/code" endpoint. A remote and
unauthenticated attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to execute arbitrary code.
