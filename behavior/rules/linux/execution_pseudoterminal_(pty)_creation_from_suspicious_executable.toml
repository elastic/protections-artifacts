description = """
This rule detects the creation of the /dev/ptmx pseudoterminal device by executables located in common temporary or
shared memory directories such as /tmp/, /var/tmp/, or /dev/shm/. While pseudoterminal creation is legitimate for
interactive terminal sessions, malware and post-exploitation tools frequently allocate PTYs to spawn interactive shells
(e.g., reverse shells) or evade detection. The use of temporary directories for staging or executing payloads is a
common tactic in Linux-based attacks, making this behavior highly suspicious.
