Detects the execution of the tclsh binary followed by an immediate network connection by tclsh linked by the
process.entity_id value. Tclsh is a shell-like application that reads Tcl commands from its standard input or from a
file and evaluates them. Tcl is a high-level programming language. It is still a default installation as of macOS 12
Monterey, making it an ideal candidate for payload execution.
