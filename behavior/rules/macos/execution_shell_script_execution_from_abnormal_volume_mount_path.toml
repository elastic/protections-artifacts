Detects the suspicious execution of a shell script from a volume mount path and outside of the standard macOS binary
execution path (/Volumes/name.app/Contents/MacOS/binary). This activity is highly abnormal and should indicate
potentially malicious activity. Threat actors have used shell scripts like this in order to download additional
tools/payloads and prepare the system for post-infection actions by establishing persistence, altering file attributes
and creating necessary directories.
