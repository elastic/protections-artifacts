Detects when an unusually large OSA script is executed by Osascript via a shell command. This specific invocation of an
OSA script is unique and very suspicious if not malicious. Recently this method of executing OSA script has been
observed being used by many different stealer samples. These stealers will include the malicious OSA script in their
binary, usually encoded, then execute it via the default shell.
