[rule]
description = """
This rule monitors for the execution of a suspicious sudo command that is leveraged in CVE-2019-14287 to escalate
privileges to root. Sudo does not verify the presence of the designated user ID and proceeds to execute using a user ID
that can be chosen arbitrarily. By using the sudo privileges, the command "sudo -u#-1" translates to an ID of 0,
representing the root user. This exploit may work for sudo versions prior to v1.28.
