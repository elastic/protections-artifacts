Identifies activity where an AppleScript applet is executed followed by the immediate execution of the "curl" command.
An attacker might use an AppleScript applet to automate malicious tasks and leverage "curl" to download additional
payloads or communicate with a command and control (C2) server. This activity has been observed being utilized by XCSSET
and more recently by a new threat deemed "Rustbucket" by JAMF to bypass Gatekeeper and download a second stage payload.
