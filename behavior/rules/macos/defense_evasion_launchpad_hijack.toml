description = """
This rule detects when the open command is used to launch the Launchpad application and the parent process is a
scripting language or the parent process is not signed or does not have a code signature. Threat actors have been seen
using the open command to launch the Launchpad application from a scripting language or from an unsigned or untrusted
process to evade detection when attempting to implement a malicious launchpad application.
