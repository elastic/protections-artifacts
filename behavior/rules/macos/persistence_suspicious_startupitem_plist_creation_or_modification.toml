Detects the creation or modification of the StartupParameters.plist file indicating the presence of a Startup Item on
the system. StartupItems have been deprecated on modern MacOS systems (post Mavericks) in favor of Launch Daemons but
they still work. The creation of a StartupItem should be highly suspicious as the vast majority of applications no
longer use this method to persist.
