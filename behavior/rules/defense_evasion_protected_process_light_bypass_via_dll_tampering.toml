Identifies attempts to tamper with a DLL associated with a Protected Process Light (PPL) process. The purpose of PPL is
to protect critical system processes against modification, access, or tampering via open process functions. An attacker
may attempt to tamper with the DLL associated with a PPL process in order to bypass PPL protection and inject malicious
code into the protected process, elevating their privileges. This privilege escalation can enable them to evade or
disable security software, and access sensitive information such as credentials.
