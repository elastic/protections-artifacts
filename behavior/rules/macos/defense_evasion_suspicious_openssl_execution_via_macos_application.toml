[rule]
description = """
Detects a suspicious sequence of events where a shell (bash, sh, or zsh) is used to launch an application from the
/Applications directory, followed by the execution of the 'openssl' command. This pattern could indicate potential
malicious activity, such as a shell script attempting to use openssl to perform encryption or decryption operations,
exfiltrating sensitive data, or interacting with command and control servers. Monitoring for such sequences can help
identify potentially compromised systems or unauthorized activities. This rule alerts on Shlayer malware activity.
