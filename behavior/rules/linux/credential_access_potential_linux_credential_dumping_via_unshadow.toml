Identifies the execution of the unshadow utility which is part of John the Ripper, a password-cracking tool on the host
machine. Malicious actors can use the utility to retrieve the combined contents of the '/etc/shadow' and '/etc/password'
files. Using the combined file generated from the utility, the malicious threat actors can use them as input for
password-cracking utilities or prepare themselves for future operations by gathering credential information of the
victim.
