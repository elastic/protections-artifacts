Detects the execution of a process in a suspicious location by the Terminal application. Terminal will, often times, be
granted full disk access by users and administrators who use it. Threat actors are aware of this and will abuse it in
order to get their payloads to execute with the same context as Terminal, providing their payload full disk access. They
do this by modifying shell profiles (e.g .zshrc, bashrc, etc.) that point to and execute their payload then when
Terminal initiates those profiles the payload gets executed within the same context as Terminal.
