Detects when disown is executed by a shell command with the responsible process having been executed from a volume
mount. The use of the disown binary on macOS is in itself an anomaly and something that almost never occurs but when
paired with being executed via a shell command from a volume mounted binary indicates malicious activity. Disown
originates from unix and allows one to remove any and all jobs from the current shell. A threat actor may do this in
order to ensure there are no current jobs executing or that may execute that could prevent their actions from completing
or cause them to be noticed.
