Detects when Curl is executed via Osascript and downloads an executable file to a suspicious location. Threat actors
will often use Curl to download malicious executables to a temporary location on the system. The use of Curl via
Osascript elevates the suspiciousness of the activity as Osascript is a scripting language that can be used to execute
AppleScript commands. The combination of these two activities is indicative of a threat actor attempting to download and
execute a malicious payload on the system.
