Detects when a self-signed binary (signed with native CodeSign tool) attempts to open the user's Keychain DB. This
activity is not normal and should be considered suspicious. The macOS keychain is highly sought after and targeted by
threat actors as it contains sensitive credential data that can be used to further compromise a user or environment.
