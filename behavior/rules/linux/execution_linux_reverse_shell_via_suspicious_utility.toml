description = """
Detects the creation of a reverse shell through a suspicious process chain spawned via a utility with suspicious command
line arguments. Reverse shells spawned by the specified utilities that are initialized from a single process followed by
a network connection attempt will be captured through this rule. Attackers may spawn reverse shells to establish
persistence onto a target system.
