description = """
This rule detects the execution of the dbus-send command with the `--type=method_call` argument, which is used to send a
method call to a D-Bus message bus. The D-Bus message bus is a system for inter-process communication (IPC) that allows
applications to communicate with each other. The dbus-send command is typically used to send messages to the D-Bus
message bus, which can be used to interact with other applications and services on the system. However, the dbus-send
command can also be used by attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system or interact with other applications in
a malicious way.
