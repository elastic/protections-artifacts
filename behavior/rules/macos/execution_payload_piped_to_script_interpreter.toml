Detects when a script interpreter executes via a shell (sh, bash, zsh) or osascript with only a single argument, being
the process name and followed immediately by a network connection. This activity occurs when script code gets piped to
the interpreter via a shell and that code is intended to reach out to an external destination like a C2 server.
