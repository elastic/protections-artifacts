Detects the execution of Python followed by a network connection by Python to a Google Drive domain and ultimately the
creation of a Python script or executable. Nation State actors have been observed engaged in several initial access
campaigns using Python coding lures that retrieve and execute secondary and even tertiary Python scripts that eventually
lead to a payload that establishes command and control.
