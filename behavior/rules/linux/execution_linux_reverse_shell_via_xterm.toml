description = """
This rule detects potential reverse shell activity initiated via the xterm terminal emulator. Attackers may use xterm to
establish a reverse shell connection to a remote host by specifying a display address that includes the attacker's IP
and port. This behavior is often indicative of unauthorized remote access attempts.
