Detects the dumping of the Apple keychain using the native "security" binary by a suspicious parent process. Dumping the
keychain file using these binaries should not be commonplace and should be considered highly abnormal, possibly
indicating malicious activity. The Apple keychain contains sensitive and valuable data an attacker could utilize to
escalate privileges, move laterally and further compromise a system or account.
