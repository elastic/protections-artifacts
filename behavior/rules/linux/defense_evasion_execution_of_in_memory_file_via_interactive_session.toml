Detects when a file descriptor in the proc (temporary) file system is executed via an interactive session. This activity
indicates an active attempt to execute an in-memory file and should be considered highly abnormal or suspicious. This
activity can occur when the memfd syscall is utilized to create a memory resident file, like a payload, and then execute
it via command and control.
