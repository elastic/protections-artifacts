Identifies the execution of a binary Linux shared memory directories: (/dev/shm/, /run/shm/). This activity is to be

high-uptime servers in these directories as system backdoors. Binaries executed from these directories are memory
resident making them harder to detect and allowing them to remain hidden for long periods of time.
