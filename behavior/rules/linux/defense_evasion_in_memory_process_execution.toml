[rule]
description = """
This rule detects when a process is executed from a memory file descriptor (memfd). Attackers may use memfd to create
and execute code directly in memory, bypassing traditional file-based detection mechanisms. The use of memfd for process
execution is uncommon and may indicate an attempt to evade security controls.
