Identifies attempts to force the LogonUI process to load an unsigned DLL via logoff action. The LogonUI.exe process will
communicate with desktop GUI processes, a malicious one may force it to load a DLL using memory mapped shellcode via
marshal/unmarshal Direct Composition objects. This may indicate a successful vulnerability exploitation for privilege
escalation.
